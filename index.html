        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I dedided to enroll in the UT Bootcamp for Full-Stack Development because I have always been curious about how 
            software worked, especially the web. As a Software Quality Engineer I had an idea, but was never given
            the opporrunity to study the code and the mystery behind why a button works when I clicked it. As a 
            tester I can verify if it works or not, but I want to be able to dig deeper when that same button doesn't function the way I expect it
            to.<br><br> I aim to learn the skills to become a full-stack developer in test. I found the work to be both 
            enjoyable and challenging. Even when I felt like throwing my laptop against the nearest wall because the code I 
            had written didn't work as expected. I contiuned on until I found my solultion and was able to clap my hands
            and yell out, "Yes!" once I hit the refresh button on my browser. Witnessing the results of a 
            working website after all of my tenactiy and hard work brings me so much joy.<br><br>
            My motivation not only comes from the desire to gain new employable skills, but to continue to be a role model
            for my children. I want them to see that we never stop learning and to always strive to be the best version of
            ourselves. I love the look on their faces when I say, "I have to do homework." It's a look of wonder
            and respect and leaves them with no excuse on why they can't get theirs done because Mommy is also
            working a full-time job. In my spare time I enjoy being with my family, watching movies, traveling, singing and volunteering at my local church.
